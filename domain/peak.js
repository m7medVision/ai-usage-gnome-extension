/* Peak-hours traffic-light logic, shared across providers.
 *
 * Each provider defines its own peak windows as a list of [startHour, endHour)
 * intervals in UTC (24h) and attaches them to its `peakstatus` menu entry via
 * the `peakWindows` field. currentPeakStatus() reports whether "now" falls in a
 * peak window and the time remaining until the next state change, so the menu
 * can render a colored dot + live countdown that matches the provider's billing
 * schedule regardless of the user's local timezone. */

/* Current peak status at "now": whether we're in a peak window and ms
 * remaining until the next state change (peak→off or off→peak).
 *
 * `windows` is a list of [startHour, endHour) intervals in UTC (24h). The
 * countdown is the nearest window boundary (any start or end) strictly after
 * the current fractional hour; if none remains today, it wraps to the earliest
 * boundary tomorrow (+24h). */
